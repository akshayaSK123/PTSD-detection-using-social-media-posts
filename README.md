Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide affecting more than 264 million people of all age groups around the world. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a form of depression that develops after exposure to a potentially traumatic event like witnessing accidents, physical or sexual assault, combat or death. In the United States, about 8 million adults have PTSD in a given year. It is a serious health condition causing persistent thoughts of traumatic memoires, insomnia, and severe anxiety. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment is of paramount importance. There are therapy methods and medications available for its effective treatment. With the growth of social media, people tend to post most of their activities online in form of text and images that might reflect their mental health condition to a great extent. Finding these indicators might help in early diagnosis and even help save a life in future.

Objective: This project focuses on finding the important markers of PTSD based on the captions and images a person posts on the social media platform, Instagram. A machine learning model is built to classify whether a person may be suffering from PTSD based on their Instagram posts (text and images).
